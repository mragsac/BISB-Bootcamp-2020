# BISB Bootcamp 2020: Day 3 (September 23, 2020)

After having separate modules for those with a molecular biology versus computational background for the first two days, we'll be syncing up for the third day of Bootcamp.

We'll start off with a brief presentation on the Graduate Bioinformatics Council (GBIC) before delving into an interactive workshop on how to log into and navigate the Triton Shared Compute Cluster (TSCC). After the mid-day faculty talks, we'll have an ice breaker activity known as "Cold Calls" before finishing up with a presentation on "Scientific Communication".
