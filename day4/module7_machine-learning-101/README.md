# Machine Learning 101

BISB Bootcamp 2020

Author: Cameron Martino, cmartino at eng dot ucsd dot edu

24 September 2020

## Workshop Goals

The goals of this workshop is to learn basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning in the context of bioinformatics. 

The notebooks are ordered numerically and expect that the pervious notebook is read prior to the start of the next (e.g. 1.0 before 2.0).
xxx
* 1.0-introduction-to-machine-learning.ipynb

This notebook explores the basic terminology and goals of machine learning. 

* 2.0-count-data-intro.ipynb

This notebook introduces normalizations and transformations common in bioinformatic based machine learning.

* 3.0-general-unsupervised-learning.ipynb

This notebook introduces unsupervised learning concepts and an use case example in real world 16S microbiome data.


* 4.0-general-supervised-learning-proceedure.ipynb

This notebook introduces supervised learning concepts and continues the real world microbiome example introduced in 3.0.
