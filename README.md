## Goals of the Bootcamp

This week-long Bootcamp aims to:

* Introduce new students to the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program, its faculty and students, and research opportunities at the University of California, San Diego
* Foster student community and collaboration among students of the first-year class and to students in upper classes
* Convey the bar for the core curriculum and key classes, as well as the research excitement and work ethic characteristic of the program's best students
* Provide incoming students with an opportunity to remedy deficiencies before taking the core classes

## Bootcamp Schedule

The complete schedule for this year's Bootcamp can be found at the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W_75n4eZAH89gtQodiZyzS3p-ubc8VppcQoLgO7li5g/edit?usp=sharing.

Additionally, each `day#` folder within this repo has the schedule for that specific day. 

## Website Organization

Each day of the Bootcamp is separated into a different folder within this repository. There are two types of folders: **presentation** folders (e.g., `intro_presentations/` and `faculty_presentations/`) which contain more administrative information about the program, and **module** folders (e.g., `module1a_bench-to-terminal` and `module1b_genetics-101`) that contain technical information and workshops.
