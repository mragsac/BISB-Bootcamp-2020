# BISB Bootcamp 2020: Day 2 (September 22, 2020)

For the second day of Bootcamp, we will start to delve into the types of data that are produced with various sequencing methods. We will also have two additional modules running simultaneously for those with a molecular biology or computational background, similar to the modules in Day 1. 

There will also be two presentations on an "Introduction to San Diego" as well as "How to Choose an Advisor".
