# BISB Bootcamp 2020: Day 5 (September 25, 2020)

For the final day of Bootcamp, we'll have several short modules in the morning, in addition to a longer module called "Software Engineering on a Team". In the afternoon, there will be a general town hall meeting for incoming students to ask questions of people in the program, including current students, administrators, and faculty.
